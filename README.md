This repository contains/will contain:
- The Arduino code for the DSCPM 2-3/1-2
- The Ardiono code for the DSCPM 2-2
- The edge detecting python scripts which generate volume infused vs. time and flow rate vs. time plots from horizontal (left to right), pre-cropped videos of dyed fluid infusing into micro-bore tubing
