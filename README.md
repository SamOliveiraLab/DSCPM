# The Dual Syringe Continuous Pumping Mechanism (DSCPM)
## This repository contains software and hardware schematics that accompany the article titled *A Continuous, Low Flow, and Multiplexing Pumping System for Microfluidics Applications*
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.16.608339v1

This repository contains/will contain:
- The Arduino code for the DSCPM 2-3/1-2
- The Arduino code for the DSCPM 2-2
- The Arduino code for the Fluidic Multiplexers
- The edge detecting python scripts which generate volume infused vs. time and flow rate vs. time plots from horizontal (left to right), pre-cropped videos of dyed fluid infusing into micro-bore tubing (Generative AI was used in the development of this code. The authors thoroughly confirmed the validity of the generated quantitative data with with respect to the raw data (videos), and take responsibility for what is presented.)
- Circuit diagrams for the DSCPM 2-3/1-2 and the DSCPM 2-2
